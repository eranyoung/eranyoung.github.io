            <h3 class="text-center font-semibold">The 3D-ness of this chart does not add anything to the chart and it does not convey the data in any effective way. Furthermore
                there are slices which have a different height to highlight those data points but it makes it confusing since the way the data is represented by volume does not stay consistent
                Also pie charts are bad and 3D pie charts are even worse for helping people accurately read data points as it is encoded in either area or volume.

            <h3 class="text-center font-semibold">Bar charts are far more effective for visualizing data in general. It is very easy to tell what a value is since it is simply
                encoded as the length of the bar. Furthermore, there is no need for extraneous use of color as the categories are clearly seperated without them. Instead
                color is used here to highlight an important value.</h3>

            <h3 class="text-center font-semibold">This line chart does not contain axis labels which makes it not as clear as to what is being displayed
                It must be inferred from the title. Furthermore, the y-axis is scaled in a way which makes it seem as if the values have not changed very much, but still remain
                very high. Finally, there is no color used and no labels given to each line so there is no way to tell what which line represents and makes it harder to 
                trace the lines

                Furthermore, the y-axis scale is linear so it does not skew the data in anyway and it is very easy to tell that there has been a significant drop
                in cases since 2000. Lastly, each line has a unique color as well as a legend so we know which state each line represents.
